# CS 330 • Computational Graphics & Visualization  
## Module Eight Journal — Portfolio Artifact  

**Student:** Sarah Theeb  
**Program:** B.S. Computer Science (Software Engineering concentration)  
**Course Artifact:** Final 3D Scene + Design Decisions Document

##  Artifacts Included  
- **`7-1_FinalProjectMilestone`** — Source project & compiled assets for my OpenGL scene (desk study setup: monitor, mug, notebook, lamp, floor/desk planes, textures, lighting, and camera controls).  
- **`Design_Decisions.pdf`** — Rationale for object choices, composition, textures, materials, lighting, shaders, and navigation design.  

Together, these files demonstrate my ability to create a fully realized 3D world with attention to both technical and design processes.

##  How I Approach Designing Software  
Working on this project helped me develop new design skills, especially in scene composition, material selection, and lighting design. I followed a process of decomposing reference objects into primitives, blocking out shapes, iterating with textures and lighting, and then adding navigation polish. These tactics — starting simple, iterating with intent, and balancing realism with performance — are strategies I can apply in future projects.

## How I Approach Developing Programs  
I learned to structure my code modularly with managers for shaders, views, and scenes, which kept the project organized. I used shader-first debugging to catch errors early and iterated milestone by milestone, from geometry → textures → input → lighting → polish. My development evolved from “just make it render” to intentionally tuning parameters for user experience and clarity. Iteration was essential: each milestone exposed the next problem, which I solved step by step.

##  How Computer Science Helps Me Reach My Goals  
This project strengthened my understanding of linear algebra, lighting models, and camera controls — all skills that will help in advanced courses and professional work. Computational graphics taught me how math, design, and programming intersect in real-time systems. It also gave me a tangible portfolio artifact that showcases both technical problem-solving and creative design, which I can present to future employers.
